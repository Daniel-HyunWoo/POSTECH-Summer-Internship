# POSTECH-Summer-Internship

2 code files are about the interferometer test results I made and measured during summer internship in POSTECH. Two interferometers(Michelson and Mach-Zehnder) were measured each by each
After passing the test, both interferometers were used to conduct other experiment, Delayed Choice Quantum Eraser(DEQE) with BBO(non-linear) crystal.

Unfortunately, I was not able to finish DCQE experiment due to time limit. Instead of this I gave my hand to a senior who is in the middle of Ph.D course and does Energy-Time Entanglement Experimnet. I made 12 connected bundles of Ch1 DWDM for him.
