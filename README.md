# POSTECH-Summer-Internship

2 code files are about the interferometer test results I made and measured during summer internship in POSTECH. Two interferometers(Michelson and Mach-Zehnder) were measured each by each
After passing the performance test, both interferometers were used to construct Bell Test setup using non-linear(BBO) crystal and Spontaneous Parametric Down Conversion(SPDC) phenomena.

Unfortunately, I was not able to finish Bell Test due to time limit. Instead of this I gave my hand to a senior who is in the middle of Ph.D course and does Energy-Time Entanglement Experimnet.
